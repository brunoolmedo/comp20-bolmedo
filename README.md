The purpose of this repository is to have a code portfolio showing a diverse set of web programming skills. 

My favorite assignment was the group project. My team was incredible. I love all of them. It was also the most revealing assignment in terms of realizing what I want to do with my future. I took this class to see if I am interested in deb development, as many people probably did, and found out that I am not. However, I am incredibly interested in web design. I had more fun than I care to admit styling our final project.

The first day I could not tell you what HTML or CSS stand for, much less what a collection in a database is. I have grown IMMENSELY from day one. 

The most important thing I learned during this course, as I said before, was that I am more interested in web design than web development. This was very much a soul-searching class for me, and this class has helped me narrow down even more into what I am truly passionate about. 
Examples of this would be styling the final project, and styling our personal websites. In fact, the growth from when I styled my website to when I styled the final project itself is an example of growth itself.

Now that I've finished the course I want to learn the ins and outs of CSS and Javascript styling.
