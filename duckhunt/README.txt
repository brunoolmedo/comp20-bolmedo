Name: Bruno Olmedo
1. This assignment was completed to the best of my knowledge, except I totally forgot to push this README file at the end of Tuesday, so I guess it was just missing this and I just noticed.
2. I worked with Josh Berl and Rachael Robinson and referred to the links provided in the assignment a lot.
3. I spent about 6 hours on the assignment
